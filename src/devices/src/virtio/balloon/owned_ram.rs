//! Guest RAM files this VMM created, whose surrendered pages may be released
//! back to the host by punching them out of the file.
//!
//! A branchable machine's RAM is a file (a memfd on Linux, a temp file on
//! macOS) mapped shared, so dropping a page table entry frees nothing: the page
//! lives on in the file. Releasing it means removing it from the file, which is
//! only safe while no other process maps that file. Checkpoint generations are
//! independent copies (a sealed memfd, an APFS clone) and restored clones map
//! someone else's file, so neither is ever released here. The one way another
//! process maps a live RAM file is a frozen-golden fork, which marks the RAM
//! shared before it freezes, and from then on nothing is punched.
